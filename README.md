# Binary <-> ASCII converter (TKinter)
Very simple TKinter binary <-> ascii converter with an additional XOR encryption/decryption tool between ascii <-> base64. The interface is rudimentary at best, but I found myself needing a XOR -> base64 tool, so here we are. I may redesign the interface later and add some more encryption/decryption modes.
