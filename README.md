# Binary <-> ASCII converter (TKinter)
Little binary <-> ascii widget in TKinter. Write either text or 8-bit binary to translate between them. The formatting of the binary does not matter; you can write "01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100001" or omit the spaces, or even add them if you like, and it'll work all the same.
